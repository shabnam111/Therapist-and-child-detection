To develop an optimized inference pipeline for detecting and tracking the child and therapist in long-duration videos, we'll utilize state-of-the-art deep learning models for object detection and tracking. The following steps outline the process:

1. Object Detection Model:
    We'll use a pre-trained model like YOLOv8 or EfficientDet for object detection. These models are efficient and accurate for real-time detection.
2. Object Tracking Model:
    For tracking, we'll use a deep learning-based tracker like DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric). DeepSORT works well with YOLO and allows us to assign unique IDs to detected objects.
3. Inference Pipeline Steps:
    1. Load Video: Load the input video.
    2. Detection and Tracking:
        . For each frame, detect objects (child and therapist) using the YOLO or EfficientDet model.
        . Pass the detections to the DeepSORT tracker to maintain unique IDs for each detected object.

    3. Annotate Frames: Overlay bounding boxes, class labels, and unique IDs on the video frames.
    4. Save/Display Video: Save the output video with the annotations.
4. Implementation of Code
5. Steps to Execute:
    1. Install Dependencies:
        . pip install opencv-python torch yolov8 deep_sort_pytorch
        . youtube-dl -f best -o video.mp4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9YDDpo9LWg

    2. Run the Pipeline: Execute the script with the paths to your input video and the desired output location.
    3.View the Output: The processed video will display bounding boxes, class labels, and unique IDs for the child and therapist.
6. Testing with Your Videos:
Upload your test videos to a Google Drive and download them to your local environment.
Run the above pipeline on the videos to generate annotated output videos.
This pipeline should efficiently handle long-duration videos, providing accurate detection and tracking of both the child and therapist, with predictions overlaid on the video.
